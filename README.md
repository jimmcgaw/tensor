# Hello TensorFlow

This repo is for a brief foray into deep learning with TensorFlow library.

## Installation

Want to play along at home? First, credit where credit is due. I'm using the [TensorFlow docs](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.8/tutorials/index.html) and the book [First Contact With TensorFlow](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01DUH73K4)

Clone this repo. Create a virtualenv named as you see fit (or just use system Python),
and install dependencies by running:

``` $ pip install -r requirements.txt ```

To test your installation, run:

``` $ python multiply.py ```

That should output the product (9.0) of the two floats declared in that file.

## Matplotlib

If you're running any code that requires the matplotlib function calls inside of virtualenv,
you might run into issues. See the [Matplotlib docs about virtualenvs](http://matplotlib.org/faq/virtualenv_faq.html#osx).
