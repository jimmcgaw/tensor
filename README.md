# Hello TensorFlow

This repo is for a brief foray into deep learning with TensorFlow library.

## Installation

Want to play along at home? First, credit where credit is due. I'm using the [TensorFlow docs](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.8/tutorials/index.html) and the book [First Contact With TensorFlow](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01DUH73K4)

Clone this repo. Create a virtualenv named as you see fit (or just use system Python),
and install dependencies by running:

``` $ pip install -r requirements.txt ```

This is installing numpy, scipy, matplotlib, and some other libs that depend on these. Expect installation to take
several minutes in your virtualenv if starting from scratch.

To test your installation, run:

``` $ python multiply.py ```

That should output the product (9.0) of the two floats declared in that file.

## Matplotlib

If you're running any code that requires the matplotlib function calls inside of virtualenv,
you might run into issues. See the [Matplotlib docs about virtualenvs](http://matplotlib.org/faq/virtualenv_faq.html#osx).
